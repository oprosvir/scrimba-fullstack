## 🎯 Project Overview

In this project, I focused on creating a pixel-perfect implementation matching the Figma design. Additionally, I completed all stretch goals: added a password length slider, implemented toggle checkboxes for symbols and numbers, and created a copy-on-click feature — all because I was curious to learn how these features work.
